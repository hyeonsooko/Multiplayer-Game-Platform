# Multiplayer Game Platform  

A real-time multiplayer game platform where users can connect, play, and compete! This project includes user authentication, matchmaking, and leaderboard functionality, starting with a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game.  

---

## Goals  
### Key Features  
- **User Authentication**: Sign up, log in, log out using JWT.  
- **Matchmaking System**: Connect players to start a game.  
- **Real-Time Gameplay**: Play games (e.g., Tic-Tac-Toe) in real-time.  
- **Leaderboard**: Track and display player rankings.  

### Minimum Viable Product (MVP)  
- Two players can play a real-time game, with match results saved in the database.  

---

## Tech Stack  
### Frontend  
- **React.js**: Component-based UI design.  
- **TailwindCSS**: For responsive and rapid styling.  

### Backend  
- **Node.js (Express)**: Lightweight server framework.  
- **Socket.IO**: Enables real-time communication.  

### Database  
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for managing users, games, and results.  
- **Redis (optional)**: For efficient matchmaking queue handling.

## Workflow  

1. **Setup Backend and Frontend**  
   - Create the folder structure:  
     - `server/`: Backend using Express.  
     - `client/`: Frontend using React.  
   - Establish basic communication between client and server.  

2. **Implement User Authentication**  
   - Use MongoDB to store user credentials.  
   - Create authentication APIs using JWT for secure access.  

3. **Build Real-Time Game and Matchmaking**  
   - Implement WebSocket communication with Socket.IO.  
   - Add basic game logic (starting with Tic-Tac-Toe).  

4. **Save Game Results and Display Leaderboard**  
   - Store match results in MongoDB.  
   - Develop a leaderboard to rank players based on performance.  

5. **Improve UI/UX and Deploy**  
   - Design a user-friendly game interface.  
   - Deploy the app to AWS, Vercel, or Heroku.

## Next Steps  

- [ ] Set up the development environment (React for client, Express for server).  
- [ ] Create basic server-client communication using Socket.IO.  
- [ ] Add user authentication (sign up, log in).  
- [ ] Build the matchmaking system and game logic.  
- [ ] Design and deploy the final product.
