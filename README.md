Matchmaking system for connecting players.
Real-time gameplay (e.g., Tic-Tac-Toe).
Game results storage and leaderboard display.
MVP (Minimum Viable Product):

Tech Stack
Frontend
React.js: Component-based UI design.
TailwindCSS: For fast and responsive styling.
Backend
Node.js (Express): Lightweight and scalable server framework.
Socket.IO: For real-time communication.
Database
MongoDB: NoSQL database for rapid prototyping.
Redis (optional): For optimized match queue handling.
Workflow
Step 1: Setup Backend and Frontend

Create the project folder structure:
server/: Backend using Express.
client/: Frontend using React.
Establish basic communication between client and server.
Step 2: Implement User Authentication

Set up a MongoDB database.
Create APIs for user signup, login, and authentication (using JWT).
Step 3: Real-Time Game and Matchmaking

Use WebSocket (via Socket.IO) to enable real-time communication.
Implement simple game logic (e.g., Tic-Tac-Toe).
Step 4: Store Game Results and Display Leaderboard

Save match results to the database.
Create a leaderboard that ranks players based on their wins/losses.
Step 5: UI/UX Improvements and Deployment

Design an intuitive game interface.
Deploy the application to AWS, Vercel, or Heroku.
